# Experiment prop types from schema

Concept prop type checker using [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox). 

## Background 
Generally speaking Zod or another mainstream validator would likely be a better option. 
However, I enjoy typebox as it leans more declarative and is easier to compose in function form.

## PropTypes removal in React 19
> [!important]
> React has removed proptypes in react 19, using any method like this is no longer viable directly.
> The React team recommends using Typescript instead.
